# GOV.UK Notify – Technical Documentation

## Getting started

### Docker container

In order to make local development easy, we run app commands through a Docker container. Run the following to set this up:

```shell
make bootstrap-with-docker
```

Because the container caches things like packages, you will need to run this again if you change the package versions.

## To run the application

```shell
make run-with-docker
```

If all goes well something like the following output will be displayed:

```
== The Middleman is loading
== LiveReload accepting connections from ws://192.168.0.8:35729
== View your site at "http://Laptop.local:4567", "http://192.168.0.8:4567"
== Inspect your site configuration at "http://Laptop.local:4567/__middleman", "http://192.168.0.8:4567/__middleman"
```

You should now be able to view a live preview at http://localhost:4567.

## Making changes

To make changes edit the source files in the `source` folder.

Although a single page of HTML is generated the markdown is spread across
multiple files to make it easier to manage. They can be found in
`source/documentation`.

A new markdown file isn't automatically included in the generated output. If we
add a new markdown file at the location `source/documentation/agile/scrum.md`,
the following snippet in `source/index.html.md.erb`, includes it in the
generated output.

```
<%= partial 'documentation/agile/scrum' %>
```

Including files manually like this lets us specify the position they appear in
the page.

## Deployment

The tech docs are built and deployed in a Concourse pipeline, using a container image built from the Dockerfile in the `docker` directory.

When running locally we use the `ruby_build` target, which runs the app using the Middleman server. When running in preview or production
(the app is not deployed in staging) we use the `production` target which runs with NGINX.
