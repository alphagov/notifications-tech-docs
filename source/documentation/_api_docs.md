# REST API documentation

This documentation is for developers interested in using the GOV.UK Notify API to send emails, text messages or letters.

You can use it to integrate directly with the API if you cannot use one of our 6 client libraries.

## Base URL
```
https://api.notifications.service.gov.uk
```

## Headers

### Authorisation header

The authorisation header is an [API key](#api-keys) that is encoded using [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/). You must include an authorisation header.

JSON Web Tokens have a standard header and a payload. The header consists of:

```json
{
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "HS256"
}
```

The payload consists of:

```json
{
  "iss": "26785a09-ab16-4eb0-8407-a37497a57506",
  "iat": 1568818578
}
```

JSON Web Tokens are encoded using a secret key with the following format:

```
3d844edf-8d35-48ac-975b-e847b4f122b0
```

That secret key forms a part of your [API key](#api-keys), which follows the format `{key_name}-{iss-uuid}-{secret-key-uuid}`.

For example, if your API key is
`my_test_key-26785a09-ab16-4eb0-8407-a37497a57506-3d844edf-8d35-48ac-975b-e847b4f122b0`:

* your API key name is `my_test_key`
* your iss (your service id) is `26785a09-ab16-4eb0-8407-a37497a57506`
* your secret key is `3d844edf-8d35-48ac-975b-e847b4f122b0`

`iat` (issued at) is the current time in UTC in epoch seconds. The token expires within 30 seconds of the current time.

Refer to the [JSON Web Tokens website](https://jwt.io/) for more information on encoding your authorisation header.

When you have an encoded and signed token, add that token to a header as follows:

```json
"Authorization": "Bearer encoded_jwt_token"
```

### Content header

The content header is `application/json`:

```json
"Content-type": "application/json"
```

## Send a message

You can use GOV.UK Notify to send text messages, emails and letters.

### Send a text message

```
POST /v2/notifications/sms
```

#### Request body

```json
{
  "phone_number": "+447900900123",
  "template_id": "f33517ff-2a88-4f6e-b855-c550268ce08a"
}
 ```

#### Arguments

```json
"personalisation": {
  "first_name": "Amala",
  "application_date": "2018-01-01",
}
```

You can leave out this argument if a template does not have any placeholder fields for personalised information.

##### reference (optional)

An identifier you can create if necessary. This reference identifies a single notification or a batch of notifications. It must not contain any personal information such as name or postal address. For example:

```json
"reference": "STRING"
```

You can leave out this argument if you do not have a reference.

##### sms_sender_id (optional)

A unique identifier of the sender of the text message notification.

### Send a file by email

To send a file by email, add a placeholder to the template then upload a file. The placeholder will contain a secure link to download the file.

The links are unique and unguessable. GOV.UK Notify cannot access or decrypt your file.

Your file will be available to download for a default period of 26 weeks (6 months).

To help protect your files you can also:

* ask recipients to confirm their email address before downloading
* choose the length of time that a file is available to download

#### Add contact details to the file download page

1. [Sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in).
1. Go to the __Settings__ page.
1. In the __Email__ section, select __Manage__ on the __Send files by email__ row.
1. Enter the contact details you want to use, and select __Save__.

#### Add a placeholder to the template

1. [Sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in).
1. Go to the __Templates__ page and select the relevant email template.
1. Select __Edit__.
1. Add a placeholder to the email template using double brackets. For example: "Download your file at: ((link_to_file))"

Your email should also tell recipients how long the file will be available to download.

#### Upload your file

You can upload the following file types:

- PDF (.pdf)
- CSV (.csv)
- Text (.odt, .txt, .rtf)
- MS Word Document (.doc, .docx)
- Ms Excel Spreadsheet (.xlsx)

Your file must be smaller than 2MB. [Contact the GOV.UK Notify team](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/support/ask-question-give-feedback) if you need to send other file types.

You’ll need to convert the file into a string that is base64 encoded.

Pass the encoded string into an object with a `file` key, and put that in the personalisation argument. For example:

```json
"personalisation":{
  "first_name": "Amala",
  "application_date": "2018-01-01",
  "link_to_file": {"file": "file as base64 encoded string"}
}
```

##### CSV Files

Uploads for CSV files should set the `is_csv` flag as `true` to ensure it’s downloaded as a .csv file. For example:

```json
"personalisation":{
  "first_name": "Amala",
  "application_date": "2018-01-01",
  "link_to_file": {"file": "CSV file as base64 encoded string", "is_csv": true}
}
```

#### Ask recipients to confirm their email address before they can download the file

When a recipient clicks the link in the email you’ve sent them, they have to enter their email address. Only someone who knows the recipient’s email address can download the file.

This security feature is turned on by default.

##### Turn off email address check (not recommended)

If you do not want to use this feature, you can turn it off on a file-by-file basis.

You should not turn this feature off if you send files that contain:

* personally identifiable information
* commercially sensitive information
* information classified as ‘OFFICIAL’ or ‘OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE’ under the [Government Security Classifications](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications) policy

To let the recipient download the file without confirming their email address, set the `confirm_email_before_download` flag to `false`.


```json
"personalisation":{
  "first_name": "Amala",
  "application_date": "2018-01-01",
  "link_to_file": {"file": "file as base64 encoded string", "confirm_email_before_download": false}
}
```

#### Choose the length of time that a file is available to download

Set the number of weeks you want the file to be available using the `retention_period` key.

You can choose any value between 1 week and 78 weeks.

If you do not choose a value, the file will be available for the default period of 26 weeks (6 months).

Files sent before 12 April 2023 had a longer default period of 78 weeks (18 months).

```json
"personalisation":{
  "first_name": "Amala",
  "application_date": "2018-01-01",
  "link_to_file": {"file": "file as base64 encoded string", "retention_period": "4 weeks"}
}
```

#### Response

If the request to the client is successful, the client returns a `dict`:

```json

### Send a letter

When you add a new service it will start in [trial mode](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/features/trial-mode). You can only send letters when your service is live.

To send Notify a request to go live:

1. [Sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in).
1. Go to the __Settings__ page.
1. In the __Your service is in trial mode__ section, select __request to go live__.

```
POST /v2/notifications/letter
```

#### Request body

```json
{
  "template_id": "f33517ff-2a88-4f6e-b855-c550268ce08a",
  "personalisation": {
    "address_line_1": "The Occupier",
    "address_line_2": "123 High Street",
    "address_line_3": "SW14 6BH"
  }
}
```

#### Arguments

##### template_id (required)

To find the template ID:

1. [Sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in).
1. Go to the __Templates__ page and select the relevant template.
1. Select __Copy template ID to clipboard__.

##### personalisation (required)

The personalisation argument always contains the following parameters for the letter recipient’s address:

- `address_line_1`
- `address_line_2`
- `address_line_3`
- `address_line_4`
- `address_line_5`
- `address_line_6`
- `address_line_7`

The address must have at least 3 lines.

The last line needs to be a real UK postcode or the name of a country outside the UK.

Notify checks for international addresses and will automatically charge you the correct postage.

The `postcode` personalisation argument has been replaced. If your template still uses `postcode`, Notify will treat it as the last line of the address.

Any other placeholder fields included in the letter template also count as required parameters. You need to provide their values in a dictionary with key value pairs. For example:

```json
"personalisation":{
  "address_line_1": "The Occupier",
  "address_line_2": "123 High Street",
  "address_line_3": "Richmond upon Thames",
  "address_line_4": "Middlesex",
  "address_line_5": "SW14 6BF",
  "name": "John Smith",
  "application_id": "4134325"
}
```

##### reference (optional)

An identifier you can create if necessary. This reference identifies a single notification or a batch of notifications. It must not contain any personal information such as name or postal address. For example:

```json
"reference":"STRING"
```

#### Response

If the request is successful, the response body is `json` and the status code is `201`:

### Get the status of multiple messages

This API call returns one page of up to 250 messages and statuses. You can get either the most recent messages, or get older messages by specifying a particular notification ID in the `older_than` argument.

You can only get the status of messages that are 7 days old or newer.

```
GET /v2/notifications
```

##### All messages

This will return all your messages with statuses. They will display in pages of up to 250 messages each.

- [`template_type`](#template-type-optional)
- [`status`](#status-optional)
- [`reference`](#get-the-status-of-multiple-messages-arguments-reference-optional)
- [`older_than`](#older-than-optional)

#### Arguments

You can omit any of these arguments to ignore these filters.

##### template_type (optional)

You can filter by:

* `email`

* `letter`

##### status (optional)

You can filter by each:

* [email status](#email-status-descriptions)
* [text message status](#text-message-status-descriptions)
* [letter status](#letter-status-descriptions)
* [precompiled letter status](#precompiled-letter-status-descriptions)

You can leave out this argument to ignore this filter.

##### reference (optional)

An identifier you can create if necessary. This reference identifies a single notification or a batch of notifications. It must not contain any personal information such as name or postal address. For example:

```json
"reference": "STRING"
```
