# PHP client documentation

This documentation is for developers interested in using the GOV.UK Notify PHP client to send emails, text messages or letters.

## Set up the client

The Notify PHP Client is based on a [PSR-7 HTTP model](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) [external link]. To install it, you must select your preferred PSR-7 compatible HTTP client. You can follow these instructions to use [Guzzle v7](https://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/7.0/)[external link].

### Guzzle v7

1. Use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)  [external link] to install the GOV.UK Notify PHP client. Run the following in the command line:

    ```sh
    composer require php-http/guzzle7-adapter alphagov/notifications-php-client
    ```

    You can now use the [autoloader](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading) [external link] to download the GOV.UK Notify PHP client.

1. Add the following code to your application to create a new instance of the client:

    ```
    $notifyClient = new \Alphagov\Notifications\Client([
        'apiKey' => '{your api key}',
        'httpClient' => new \Http\Adapter\Guzzle7\Client
    ]);
    ```

To get an API key, [sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in) and go to the __API integration__ page. You can find more information in the [API keys](#api-keys) section of this documentation.

## Send a message

You can use GOV.UK Notify to send text messages, emails and letters.

### Send a text message

#### Method

```php
sendSms( $phoneNumber, $templateId, array $personalisation = array(), $reference = '', $smsSenderId = NULL  )
```

For example:

```php
try {
    $response = $notifyClient->sendSms(
        '+447777111222',
        'df10a23e-2c6d-4ea5-87fb-82e520cbf93a', [
            'name' => 'Betty Smith',
            'dob'  => '12 July 1968'
        ],
        'unique_ref123',
        '862bfaaf-9f89-43dd-aafa-2868ce2926a9'
    );

} catch (ApiException $e){}
```

#### Arguments

##### phoneNumber (required)

The phone number of the recipient of the text message. This can be a UK or international number.

##### templateId (required)

To find the template ID:

1. [Sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in).
1. Go to the __Templates__ page and select the relevant template.
1. Select __Copy template ID to clipboard__.

##### personalisation (optional)

If a template has placeholder fields for personalised information such as name or application date, you must provide their values in a dictionary with key value pairs. For example:

```php
$personalisation = [
    'name' => 'Amala',
    'application_date'  => '2018-01-01'
];
```

You can leave out this argument if a template does not have any placeholder fields for personalised information.

##### reference (optional)

A unique identifier you can create if necessary. This reference identifies a single unique notification or a batch of notifications. It must not contain any personal information such as name or postal address. For example:

```php
$reference = 'STRING';
```
You can leave out this argument if you do not have a reference.

##### smsSenderId (optional)

A unique identifier of the sender of the text message notification.

To find the text message sender:

1. [Sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in).
1. Go to the __Settings__ page.
1. In the __Text Messages__ section, select __Manage__ on the __Text Message sender__ row.

You can then either:

- copy the sender ID that you want to use and paste it into the method
- select __Change__ to change the default sender that the service will use, and select __Save__

```php
$smsSenderId='8e222534-7f05-4972-86e3-17c5d9f894e2'
```

You can leave out this argument if your service only has one text message sender, or if you want to use the default sender.

#### Response

If the request to the client is successful, the client returns an `array`:

```php
[
    "id" => "bfb50d92-100d-4b8b-b559-14fa3b091cda",
    "reference" => None,
    "content" => [
        "body" => "Some words",
        "from_number" => "40604"
    ],
    "uri" => "https =>//api.notifications.service.gov.uk/v2/notifications/ceb50d92-100d-4b8b-b559-14fa3b091cd",

    ]
];
```

If you are using the [test API key](#test), all your messages will come back with a `delivered` status.

All messages sent using the [team and guest list](#team-and-guest-list) or [live](#live) keys will appear on your dashboard.

#### Error codes

If the request is not successful, the client returns an `Alphagov\Notifications\Exception\ApiException` object containing the relevant error code.

```

You can leave out this argument if your service only has one email reply-to address, or you want to use the default email address.

### Send a file by email

To send a file by email, add a placeholder to the template then upload a file. The placeholder will contain a secure link to download the file.

The links are unique and unguessable. GOV.UK Notify cannot access or decrypt your file.

Your file will be available to download for a default period of 26 weeks (6 months).

To help protect your files you can also:

* ask recipients to confirm their email address before downloading
* choose the length of time that a file is available to download

#### Add contact details to the file download page

1. [Sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in).
1. Go to the __Settings__ page.
1. In the __Email__ section, select __Manage__ on the __Send files by email__ row.
1. Enter the contact details you want to use, and select __Save__.

#### Add a placeholder to the template

1. [Sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in).
1. Go to the __Templates__ page and select the relevant email template.
1. Select __Edit__.
1. Add a placeholder to the email template using double brackets. For example: "Download your file at: ((link_to_file))"

Your email should also tell recipients how long the file will be available to download.

#### Upload your file

You can upload PDF, CSV, JSON, .odt, .txt, .rtf, .xlsx and MS Word Document files. Your file must be smaller than 2MB.. [Contact the GOV.UK Notify team](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/support/ask-question-give-feedback) if you need to send other file types.

Pass the file object as a value into the personalisation argument. For example:

```php
try {
    $file_data = file_get_contents('/path/to/my/file.pdf');

    $response = $notifyClient->sendEmail(
        'betty@example.com',
        'df10a23e-2c0d-4ea5-87fb-82e520cbf93c',
        [
            'name' => 'Betty Smith',
            'dob'  => '12 July 1968',
            'link_to_file' => $notifyClient->prepareUpload( $file_data )
        ]
    );
}
catch (ApiException $e){}
catch (InvalidArgumentException $e){}
```

##### CSV Files

Uploads for CSV files should use the `is_csv` parameter on the `prepareUpload()` helper method.  For example:

```php
try {
    $file_data = file_get_contents('/path/to/my/file.csv');

    $response = $notifyClient->sendEmail(
        'betty@example.com',
        'df10a23e-2c0d-4ea5-87fb-82e520cbf93c',
        [
            'name' => 'Betty Smith',
            'dob'  => '12 July 1968',
            'link_to_file' => $notifyClient->prepareUpload( $file_data, true )
        ]
    );
}
catch (ApiException $e){}
catch (InvalidArgumentException $e){}
```

#### Ask recipients to confirm their email address before they can download the file

When a recipient clicks the link in the email you’ve sent them, they have to enter their email address. Only someone who knows the recipient’s email address can download the file.

This security feature is turned on by default.

##### Turn off email address check (not recommended)

If you do not want to use this feature, you can turn it off on a file-by-file basis.

To do this you will need version 4.2.0 of the PHP client library, or a more recent version.

You should not turn this feature off if you send files that contain:

* personally identifiable information
* commercially sensitive information
* information classified as ‘OFFICIAL’ or ‘OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE’ under the [Government Security Classifications](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications) policy

To let the recipient download the file without confirming their email address, set the `confirm_email_before_download` flag to `false`.

```php
try {
    $file_data = file_get_contents('/path/to/my/file.pdf');

    $response = $notifyClient->sendEmail(
        'betty@example.com',
        'df10a23e-2c0d-4ea5-87fb-82e520cbf93c',
        [
            'name' => 'Betty Smith',
            'dob'  => '12 July 1968',
            'link_to_file' => $notifyClient->prepareUpload( $file_data, false, false )
        ]
    );
}
catch (ApiException $e){}
catch (InvalidArgumentException $e){}
```

#### Choose the length of time that a file is available to download

Set the number of weeks you want the file to be available using the `retentionPeriod` key.

To use this feature will need version 4.2.0 of the PHP client library, or a more recent version.

You can choose any value between 1 week and 78 weeks. When deciding this, you should consider:

* the need to protect the recipient’s personal information
* whether the recipient will need to download the file again later

If you do not choose a value, the file will be available for the default period of 26 weeks (6 months).

Files sent before 12 April 2023 had a longer default period of 78 weeks (18 months).

```php
try {
    $file_data = file_get_contents('/path/to/my/file.pdf');

    $response = $notifyClient->sendEmail(
        'betty@example.com',
        'df10a23e-2c0d-4ea5-87fb-82e520cbf93c',
        [
            'name' => 'Betty Smith',
            'dob'  => '12 July 1968',
            'link_to_file' => $notifyClient->prepareUpload( $file_data, false, null, "52 weeks" )
        ]
    );
}
catch (ApiException $e){}
catch (InvalidArgumentException $e){}
```

#### Response

If the request to the client is successful, the client returns an `array`:

```
[
    "id" => "bfb50d92-100d-4b8b-b559-14fa3b091cda",
    "reference" => None,
    "content" => [
        "subject" => "SUBJECT TEXT",
        "body" => "MESSAGE TEXT",
        "from_email" => "SENDER EMAIL
    ],
    "uri" => "https://api.notifications.service.gov.uk/v2/notifications/ceb50d92-100d-4b8b-b559-14fa3b091cd",
    "template" => [
        "id" => "ceb50d92-100d-4b8b-b559-14fa3b091cda",
        "version" => 1,
        "uri" => "https://api.notificaitons.service.gov.uk/service/your_service_id/templates/bfb50d92-100d-4b8b-b559-14fa3b091cda"
    ]
];
```


#### Error codes

### Send a letter

#### Prerequisites

When you add a new service it will start in [trial mode](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/features/trial-mode). You can only send letters when your service is live.

To send Notify a request to go live:

1. [Sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in).
1. Go to the __Settings__ page.
1. In the __Your service is in trial mode__ section, select __request to go live__.

#### Method

```php
sendLetter( $templateId, array $personalisation = array(), $reference = '' )
```
For example:

```php
try {

    $response = $notifyClient->sendEmail(
        'df10a23e-2c0d-4ea5-87fb-82e520cbf93c',
        [
            'name'=>'Fred',
            'address_line_1' => 'Foo',
            'address_line_2' => 'Bar',
            'address_line_3' => 'SW1 1AA'
        ],
        'unique_ref123'
    );

} catch (ApiException $e){}
```

#### Arguments

##### templateId (required)

To find the template ID:

1. [Sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in).
1. Go to the __Templates__ page and select the relevant template.
1. Select __Copy template ID to clipboard__.

##### personalisation (required)

The personalisation argument always contains the following parameters for the letter recipient’s address:

- `address_line_1`
- `address_line_2`
- `address_line_3`
- `address_line_4`
- `address_line_5`
- `address_line_6`
- `address_line_7`

The address must have at least 3 lines.

The last line needs to be a real UK postcode or the name of a country outside the UK.

Notify checks for international addresses and will automatically charge you the correct postage.

The `postcode` personalisation argument has been replaced. If your template still uses `postcode`, Notify will treat it as the last line of the address.

Any other placeholder fields included in the letter template also count as required parameters. You need to provide their values in a dictionary with key value pairs. For example:

```php
$personalisation =
          [
            'address_line_1' => 'The Occupier',
            'address_line_2' => '123 High Street',
            'address_line_3' => 'Richmond upon Thames',
            'address_line_4' => 'Middlesex',
            'address_line_5' => 'SW14 6BF',
            'name' => 'John Smith',
            'application_id' => '4134325'
          ];
```

##### reference (optional)

A unique identifier you can create if necessary. This reference identifies a single unique notification or a batch of notifications. It must not contain any personal information such as name or postal address. For example:

```php
$reference = 'STRING';
```

#### Response

If the request to the client is successful, the client returns an `array`:

```php
[
    "id" => "bfb50d92-100d-4b8b-b559-14fa3b091cda",
    "reference" => "unique_ref123",
    "content" => [
        "subject" => "Licence renewal",
        "body" => "Dear Bill, your licence is due for renewal on 3 January 2016.",
    ],
    "uri" => "https://api.notifications.service.gov.uk/v2/notifications/ceb50d92-100d-4b8b-b559-14fa3b091cd",
    "template" => [
        "id" => "ceb50d92-100d-4b8b-b559-14fa3b091cda",
        "version" => 1,
        "uri" => "https://api.notifications.service.gov.uk/service/your_service_id/templates/bfb50d92-100d-4b8b-b559-14fa3b091cda"
    ],
    "scheduled_for" => null
];
```

#### Error codes

If the request is not successful, the client returns an `Alphagov\Notifications\Exception\ApiException` object containing the relevant error code.

You can only get the status of messages that are 7 days old or newer.

#### Method

```php
listNotifications( array $filters = array() )
```

```php
    $response = $notifyClient->listNotifications([

        'reference' => 'weekly-reminders',
        'status' => 'delivered',
        'template_type' => 'sms'
    ]);
```

You can leave out the `older_than` argument to get the 250 most recent messages.

```

If you leave out this argument, the method returns the most recent 250 notifications.

The client only returns notifications that are 7 days old or newer. If the notification specified in this argument is older than 7 days, the client returns an empty response.

#### Response

If the request to the client is successful, the client returns an `array`.

            "id" => "notify_id",
            "user_number" => "user number",

  "links" => [
     "current" => "/received-text-messages",
     "next" => "/received-text-messages?older_than=last_id_in_list"
