`No Result Found`|Check your [template ID](#get-a-template-by-id-arguments-template-id-required).|

In addition to the above, you may also encounter:

* various schema validation errors, for example when you forget to pass in an argument, or pass in an argument of a wrong type.
* errors that are not related to getting a template, but instead are related to things like authentication and rate limits. You can find a list of these errors [in the General errors section](#general-errors)
