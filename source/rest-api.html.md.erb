# REST API documentation

This documentation is for developers interested in using the GOV.UK Notify API to send emails, text messages or letters.

You can use it to integrate directly with the API if you cannot use one of our 6 client libraries.

Developers can also use [our OpenAPI file](https://github.com/alphagov/notifications-tech-docs/blob/main/openapi/publicapi_spec.json) with tools such as [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) and [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) to assist with using the REST API.  You cannot use Swagger Editor to make test API requests.

## Making a request

### Base URL
```
https://api.notifications.service.gov.uk
```

### Headers

#### Authorisation header

The authorisation header is an [API key](#api-keys) that is encoded using [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/). You must include an authorisation header.

JSON Web Tokens have a standard header and a payload. The header consists of:

```javascript
{
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "HS256"
}
```

The payload consists of:

```javascript
{
  "iss": "26785a09-ab16-4eb0-8407-a37497a57506",
  "iat": 1568818578
}
```

JSON Web Tokens are encoded using a secret key with the following format:

```
3d844edf-8d35-48ac-975b-e847b4f122b0
```

That secret key forms a part of your [API key](#api-keys), which follows the format `{key_name}-{iss-uuid}-{secret-key-uuid}`.

For example, if your API key is
`my_test_key-26785a09-ab16-4eb0-8407-a37497a57506-3d844edf-8d35-48ac-975b-e847b4f122b0`:

* your API key name is `my_test_key`
* your iss (your service id) is `26785a09-ab16-4eb0-8407-a37497a57506`
* your secret key is `3d844edf-8d35-48ac-975b-e847b4f122b0`

`iat` (issued at) is the current time in UTC in epoch seconds. The token expires within 30 seconds of the current time.

Refer to the [JSON Web Tokens website](https://jwt.io/) for more information on encoding your authorisation header.

When you have an encoded and signed token, add that token to a header as follows:

```javascript
"Authorization": "Bearer encoded_jwt_token"
```

#### Content header

The content header is `application/json`:

```javascript
"Content-type": "application/json"
```
