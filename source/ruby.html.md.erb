# Ruby client documentation

This documentation is for developers interested in using the GOV.UK Notify Ruby client to send emails, text messages or letters.

## Set up the client

### Install the client

#### Using Bundler (recommended)

Add `notifications-ruby-client` to your application's `Gemfile`, for example:

```ruby
gem "notifications-ruby-client"
```

Then run `bundle install` from your project's directory.

Refer to the [client changelog](https://github.com/alphagov/notifications-ruby-client/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for the version number and the latest updates.

#### Installing globally

Run the following from the command line:

```sh
gem install notifications-ruby-client
```

### Create a new instance of the client

Add this code to your application:

```ruby
require "notifications/client"
client = Notifications::Client.new(api_key)
```

To get an API key, [sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in) and go to the __API integration__ page. You can find more information in the [API keys](#api-keys) section of this documentation.

## Send a message

You can use GOV.UK Notify to send emails, text messages and letters.

### Send a text message

#### Method

```ruby
smsresponse = client.send_sms(
  phone_number: "+447900900123",
  template_id: "f33517ff-2a88-4f6e-b855-c550268ce08a",
)
```

#### Arguments

##### phone_number (required)

The phone number of the text message recipient. This can be a UK or international number. For example:

```ruby
phone_number: "+447900900123"
```

##### template_id (required)

To find the template ID:

1. [Sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in).
1. Go to the __Templates__ page and select the relevant template.
1. Select __Copy template ID to clipboard__.

For example:

```ruby
template_id: "f33517ff-2a88-4f6e-b855-c550268ce08a"
```

##### personalisation (optional)

If a template has placeholder fields for personalised information such as name or reference number, you must provide their values in a hash. For example:

```ruby
personalisation: {
  name: "John Smith",
  ID: "300241",
}
```

You can leave out this argument if a template does not have any placeholder fields for personalised information.

##### reference (optional)

A unique identifier you can create if necessary. This reference identifies a single unique notification or a batch of notifications. It must not contain any personal information such as name or postal address. For example:

```ruby
reference: "your_reference_string"
```

You can leave out this argument if you do not have a reference.

##### sms_sender_id (optional)

A unique identifier of the sender of the text message notification.

To find the text message sender:

1. [Sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in).
1. Go to the __Settings__ page.
1. In the __Text Messages__ section, select __Manage__ on the __Text Message sender__ row.

You can then either:

  - copy the sender ID that you want to use and paste it into the method
  - select __Change__ to change the default sender that the service uses, and select __Save__


For example:

```ruby
sms_sender_id: "8e222534-7f05-4972-86e3-17c5d9f894e2"
```

You can leave out this argument if your service only has one text message sender, or if you want to use the default sender.

#### Response

If the request to the client is successful, the client returns a `Notifications::Client:ResponseNotification` object. In the example shown in the [Method section](#method), the object is named `smsresponse`.

You can then call different methods on this object:

|Method|Information|Type|
|:---|:---|:---|
|#`smsresponse.id`|Notification UUID|String|
|#`smsresponse.reference`|`reference` argument|String|
|#`smsresponse.content`|- `body`: Message body sent to the recipient<br>- `from_number`: SMS sender number of your service|Hash|
|#`smsresponse.template`|Contains the `id`, `version` and `uri` of the template|Hash|
|#`smsresponse.uri`|Notification URL|String|

If you are using the [test API key](#test), all your messages come back with a `delivered` status.

All messages sent using the [team and guest list](#team-and-guest-list) or [live](#live) keys appear on your GOV.UK Notify dashboard.

#### Error codes

If the request is not successful, the client returns an error. To learn more about error structure, go to [Errors section](#errors).

### Send an email

#### Method

```ruby
emailresponse = client.send_email(
  email_address: "sender@something.com",
  template_id: "f33517ff-2a88-4f6e-b855-c550268ce08a",
)
```

#### Arguments

##### email_address (required)

The email address of the recipient. For example:

```ruby
email_address: "sender@something.com"
```

##### template_id (required)

To find the template ID:

1. [Sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in).
1. Go to the __Templates__ page and select the relevant template.
1. Select __Copy template ID to clipboard__.

For example:

```ruby
template_id: "f33517ff-2a88-4f6e-b855-c550268ce08a"
```

##### personalisation (optional)

If a template has placeholder fields for personalised information such as name or reference number, you must provide their values in a hash. For example:

```ruby
personalisation: {
  name: "John Smith",
  year: "2016",
  # pass in an array and it will appear as bullet points in the message:
  required_documents: ["passport", "utility bill", "other id"],
}
```

You can leave out this argument if a template does not have any placeholder fields for personalised information.

Find out how to [reduce the risk of malicious content injection in placeholders](#reducing-the-risk-of-malicious-content-injection-in-placeholders).

##### reference (optional)

A unique identifier you can create if necessary. This reference identifies a single unique notification or a batch of notifications. It must not contain any personal information such as name or postal address. For example:

```ruby
reference: "your_reference_string"
```

You can leave out this argument if you do not have a reference.

##### one_click_unsubscribe_url (recommended)

If you send subscription emails you must let recipients opt out of receiving them. Read our Using Notify page for more information about [unsubscribe links](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/using-notify/unsubscribe-links).

The one-click unsubscribe URL will be added to the headers of your email. Email clients will use it to add an unsubscribe button.

```ruby
one_click_unsubscribe_url: "https://example.com/unsubscribe.html?opaque=123456789"
```

The one-click unsubscribe URL must respond to an empty `POST` request by unsubscribing the user from your emails. You can include query parameters to help you identify the user.

Your unsubscribe URL and response must comply with the guidance specified in [Section 3.1 of IETF RFC 8058](https://www.rfcreader.com/#rfc8058_line139).

You can leave out this argument if the email being sent is not a subscription email.

You must also add an unsubscribe link to the bottom of your email. The unsubscribe link at the bottom of your email should take the email recipient to a webpage where they can confirm that they want to unsubscribe.  

Find out how to add a link when you create a __New template__ or __Edit__ an email template.  

##### email_reply_to_id (optional)

This is an email address specified by you to receive replies from your users. You must add at least one reply-to email address before your service can go live.

To add a reply-to email address:

1. [Sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in).
1. Go to the __Settings__ page.
1. In the __Email__ section, select __Manage__ on the __Reply-to email addresses__ row.
1. Select __Add reply-to address__.
1. Enter the email address you want to use, and select __Add__.

For example:

```ruby
email_reply_to_id: "8e222534-7f05-4972-86e3-17c5d9f894e2"
```

#### Reducing the risk of malicious content injection in placeholders

Notify lets you [personalise messages](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/using-notify/personalisation) using placeholders.

You can [format](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/using-notify/formatting) content or add links and urls into placeholders using Markdown. 

If you pass in information from untrusted sources (such as online forms) into your Notify template using personalisation, this may be used to add malicious content and links to notifications you send via Notify. 

The malicious content could be:

  * Markdown syntax intended to be rendered into HTML 
  * a plain text URL which would be rendered into a clickable phishing link

An example of how malicious content can be injected into Notify personalisation:

**Template in Notify**:

```ruby
Hello ((name))
```

**Personalisation**: 

```ruby
{name: "Anne Example, now [click this evil link](https://malicious.link)"}
```

**Email will appear as**: 

<pre>
 <small>Dear Anne Example, now <a href="https://malicious.link>click this evil link">click this evil link</a></small>
</pre>

We recommend you sanitise all input from untrusted sources to prevent the injection of malicious content. 
You can use a backslash to escape [individual characters](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#characters-you-can-escape). 
The characters of most concern are those that could be used to add a URL link such as `[`, `]`, `(` or `)`.


You can leave out this argument if your service only has one email reply-to address, or you want to use the default email address.

#### Response

If the request to the client is successful, the client returns a `Notifications::Client:ResponseNotification` object. In the example shown in the [Method section](#send-an-email-method), the object is named `emailresponse`.

You can then call different methods on this object to return the requested information.

|Method|Information|Type|
|:---|:---|:---|
|#`emailresponse.id`|Notification UUID|String|
|#`emailresponse.reference`|`reference` argument|String|
|#`emailresponse.content`|- `body`: Message body<br>- `subject`: Message subject<br>- `from_email`: From email address of your service found on the **Settings** page|Hash|
|#`emailresponse.template`|Contains the `id`, `version` and `uri` of the template|Hash|
|#`emailresponse.uri`|Notification URL|String|

#### Error codes

If the request is not successful, the client returns an error. To learn more about error structure, go to [Errors section](#errors).

|Error message|How to fix|

<%= partial 'documentation/error_tables/ruby/send_an_email' %>

### Send a file by email

To send a file by email, add a placeholder to the template then upload a file. The placeholder will contain a secure link to download the file.

The links are unique and unguessable. GOV.UK Notify cannot access or decrypt your file.

Your file will be available to download for a default period of 26 weeks (6 months).

To help protect your files you can also:

* ask recipients to confirm their email address before downloading
* choose the length of time that a file is available to download

#### Add contact details to the file download page

1. [Sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in).
1. Go to the __Settings__ page.
1. In the __Email__ section, select __Manage__ on the __Send files by email__ row.
1. Enter the contact details you want to use, and select __Save__.

#### Add a placeholder to the template

1. [Sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in).
1. Go to the __Templates__ page and select the relevant email template.
1. Select __Edit__.
1. Add a placeholder to the email template using double brackets. For example: "Download your file at: ((link_to_file))"

Your email should also tell recipients how long the file will be available to download.

#### Upload your file

You can upload the following file types:

- CSV (.csv)
- image (.jpeg, .jpg, .png) 
- Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet (.xlsx)
- Microsoft Word Document (.doc, .docx)
- PDF (.pdf)
- text (.json, .odt, .rtf, .txt)

Your file must be smaller than 2MB. [Contact the GOV.UK Notify team](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/support) if you need to send other file types.

1. Pass the file object as an argument to the `Notifications.prepare_upload` helper method.
1. Pass the result into the personalisation argument.

For example:

```ruby
File.open("file.pdf", "rb") do |f|
    ...
    personalisation: {
      first_name: "Amala",
      application_date: "2018-01-01",
      link_to_file: Notifications.prepare_upload(f),
    }
end
```

#### Set the filename

To do this you will need version 6.0.0 of the Ruby client library, or a more recent version.

You should provide a filename when you upload your file.

The filename should tell the recipient what the file contains. A memorable filename can help the recipient to find the file again later.

The filename must end with a file extension. For example, `.csv` for a CSV file. If you include the wrong file extension, recipients may not be able to open your file.

If you do not provide a filename for your file, Notify will:

* generate a random filename
* try to add the correct file extension

If Notify cannot add the correct file extension, recipients may not be able to open your file.

```ruby
File.open("file.csv", "rb") do |f|
    ...
    personalisation: {
      first_name: "Amala",
      application_date: "2018-01-01",
      link_to_file: Notifications.prepare_upload(f, filename: "2023-12-25-daily-report.csv"),
    }
end
```

#### Ask recipients to confirm their email address before they can download the file

When a recipient clicks the link in the email you’ve sent them, they have to enter their email address. Only someone who knows the recipient’s email address can download the file.

This security feature is turned on by default.

##### Turn off email address check (not recommended)

If you do not want to use this feature, you can turn it off on a file-by-file basis.

To do this you will need version 5.4.0 of the Ruby client library, or a more recent version.

You should not turn this feature off if you send files that contain:

* personally identifiable information
* commercially sensitive information
* information classified as ‘OFFICIAL’ or ‘OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE’ under the [Government Security Classifications](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications) policy

To let the recipient download the file without confirming their email address, set the `confirm_email_before_download` flag to `false`.



```ruby
File.open("file.pdf", "rb") do |f|
    ...
    personalisation: {
      first_name: "Amala",
      application_date: "2018-01-01",
      link_to_file: Notifications.prepare_upload(f, confirm_email_before_download: false),
    }
end
```

#### Choose the length of time that a file is available to download

Set the number of weeks you want the file to be available using the `retention_period` key.

To use this feature will need version 5.4.0 of the Ruby client library, or a more recent version.

You can choose any value between 1 week and 78 weeks. When deciding this, you should consider:

* the need to protect the recipient’s personal information
* whether the recipient will need to download the file again later

If you do not choose a value, the file will be available for the default period of 26 weeks (6 months).

Files sent before 12 April 2023 had a longer default period of 78 weeks (18 months).

```ruby
File.open("file.pdf", "rb") do |f|
    ...
    personalisation: {
      first_name: "Amala",
      application_date: "2018-01-01",
      link_to_file: Notifications.prepare_upload(f, retention_period: "52 weeks"),
    }
end
```

#### Response

If the request to the client is successful, the client returns a `Notifications::Client:ResponseNotification` object. In the example shown in the [Method section](#send-an-email-method), the object is named `emailresponse`.

You can then call different methods on this object to return the requested information.

|Method|Information|Type|
|:---|:---|:---|
|#`emailresponse.id`|Notification UUID|String|
|#`emailresponse.reference`|`reference` argument|String|
|#`emailresponse.content`|- `body`: Message body<br>- `subject`: Message subject<br>- `from_email`: From email address of your service found on the **Settings** page|Hash|
|#`emailresponse.template`|Contains the `id`, `version` and `uri` of the template|Hash|
|#`emailresponse.uri`|Notification URL|String|

#### Error codes

If the request is not successful, the client returns an error. To learn more about error structure, go to [Errors section](#errors).

### Send a letter

When you add a new service it will start in [trial mode](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/using-notify/trial-mode). You can only send letters when your service is live.

To send Notify a request to go live:

1. [Sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in).
1. Go to the __Settings__ page.
1. In the __Your service is in trial mode__ section, select __request to go live__.

#### Method

```ruby
letterresponse = client.send_letter(
  template_id: "f33517ff-2a88-4f6e-b855-c550268ce08a",
  personalisation: {
    address_line_1: "The Occupier",
    address_line_2: "123 High Street",
    address_line_3: "SW14 6BH",
  },
)
```

#### Arguments

##### template_id (required)

To find the template ID:

1. [Sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in).
1. Go to the __Templates__ page and select the relevant template.
1. Select __Copy template ID to clipboard__.

For example:

```ruby
template_id: "f33517ff-2a88-4f6e-b855-c550268ce08a"
```

##### personalisation (required)

The personalisation argument always contains the following parameters for the letter recipient’s address:

- `address_line_1`
- `address_line_2`
- `address_line_3`
- `address_line_4`
- `address_line_5`
- `address_line_6`
- `address_line_7`

The address must have at least 3 lines.

The last line needs to be a real UK postcode or the name of a country outside the UK.

Notify checks for international addresses and will automatically charge you the correct postage.

The `postcode` personalisation argument has been replaced. If your template still uses `postcode`, Notify will treat it as the last line of the address.

Any other placeholder fields included in the letter template also count as required parameters. You must provide their values in a hash. For example:


```ruby
personalisation: {
  address_line_1: "The Occupier",  # mandatory address field
  address_line_2: "123 High Street", # mandatory address field
  address_line_3: "SW14 6BH",  # mandatory address field
  name: "John Smith", # field from template
  application_date: "2018-01-01" # field from template,
  # pass in an array and it will appear as bullet points in the letter:
  required_documents: ["passport", "utility bill", "other id"],
},
```

##### reference (optional)

A unique identifier you can create if necessary. This reference identifies a single unique notification or a batch of notifications. It must not contain any personal information such as name or postal address. For example:

```ruby
reference: "your_reference_string"
```

### Get the data for multiple messages

This API call returns one page with data for up to 250 messages. You can get either the most recent messages, or get older messages by specifying a particular notification ID in the `older_than` argument.

You can only get messages that are within your data retention period. The default data retention period is 7 days. It can be changed in your Service Settings.

#### Method

```ruby
response = client.get_notifications(
  template_type: "sms",
  status: "failed",
  reference: "your_reference_string",
  older_than: "e194efd1-c34d-49c9-9915-e4267e01e92e",
)
```

You can leave out the `older_than` argument to get the 250 most recent messages.

To get older messages, pass the ID of an older notification into the `older_than` argument. This returns the next 250 oldest messages from the specified notification ID.

#### Arguments

You can leave out these arguments to ignore these filters.

##### status (optional)

The possible statuses that a notification can be in depends on the type of notification:

* [email status](#email-status-descriptions)
* [text message status](#text-message-status-descriptions)
* [letter status](#letter-status-descriptions)
* [precompiled letter status](#precompiled-letter-status-descriptions)

You can specify a single status:

```ruby
status: "failed"
```

Or multiple, by specifying an array:

```ruby
status: ["permanent-failure", "temporary-failure"]
```

You can leave out this argument to ignore this filter.

##### templateType (optional)

You can filter by:

* `email`
* `sms`
* `letter`

##### reference (optional)

A unique identifier you can create if necessary. This reference identifies a single unique notification or a batch of notifications. It must not contain any personal information such as name or postal address. For example:

```ruby
reference: "your_reference_string"
```

##### older_than (optional)

Input the ID of a notification into this argument. If you use this argument, the client returns the next 250 received notifications older than the given ID. For example:

## Get received text messages

This API call returns one page of up to 250 received text messages. You can get either the most recent messages, or get older messages by specifying a particular notification ID in the `older_than` argument.

You can only get the data for messages that are 7 days old or newer.

You can also set up [callbacks](#callbacks) for received text messages.

### Enable received text messages

To receive text messages:

1. Go to the **Text message settings** section of the **Settings** page.
1. Select **Change** on the **Receive text messages** row.

### Get a page of received text messages

#### Method

```ruby
response = client.get_received_texts(
  older_than: "e194efd1-c34d-49c9-9915-e4267e01e92e",
)
```

To get older messages, pass the ID of an older notification into the `older_than` argument. This returns the next oldest messages from the specified notification ID.

If you leave out the `older_than` argument, the client returns the most recent 250 notifications.

#### Arguments

##### older_than (optional)

Input the ID of a received text message into this argument. If you use this argument, the client returns the next 250 received text messages older than the given ID. For example:

```ruby
older_than: "8e222534-7f05-4972-86e3-17c5d9f894e2"
```

If you leave out the `older_than` argument, the client returns the most recent 250 notifications.

The client only returns notifications that are 7 days old or newer. If the notification specified in this argument is older than 7 days, the client returns an empty `collection` response.

#### Response

If the request to the client is successful, the client returns a `Notifications::Client::ReceivedTextCollection` object. In the example shown in the [Method section](#get-a-page-of-received-text-messages-method), the object is named `response`.

You must then call either the `.links` method or the `.collection` method on this object.

|Method|Information|
|:---|:---|
|#`response.links`|Returns a hash linking to the requested texts (limited to 250)|
|#`response.collection`|Returns an array of the required texts|

If you call the `collection` method on this object to return an array, you must then call the following methods on the received texts in this array to return information on those texts:

|Method|Information|Type|
|:---|:---|:---|
|#`response.id`|Received text UUID|String|
|#`response.created_at`|Date and time of received text|String|
|#`response.content`|Received text content|String|
|#`response.notify_number`|Number that received text was sent to|String|
|#`response.service_id`|Received text service ID|String|
|#`response.user_number`|Number that received text was sent from|String|

If the notification specified in the `older_than` argument is older than 7 days, the client returns an empty `collection` response.

<%= partial 'documentation/error_tables/ruby/get_a_page_of_received_text_messages' %>


## Errors

### Error handling

If the request is not successful, the client raises a `Notifications::Client::RequestError` exception (or a subclass).

This error consists of:

- a status code, for example `400`
- an error class, for example `BadRequestError`
- a message, for example `Mobile numbers can only include: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ( ) + -`

To access these details about the error, read its `error.code`, `error.class`, and `error.message` fields, for example:

```ruby
require_relative "lib/notifications/client/request_error"

begin
  response = client.send_sms(
    phone_number: "+447700900123",
    template_id: "f33517ff-2a88-4f6e-b855-c550268ce08a",
  )
rescue Notifications::Client::RequestError => e
  if (500..599).include? e.code  # using status code for error handling
    # retry logic goes here
  else
    puts e.message  # accessing error details to debug
  end
else
    # unexpected error, raise!
end

```

Error's `message` field is a string, for example:

```ruby
"BadRequestError: Template not found"
```
